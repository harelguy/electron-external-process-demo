# Electron demo - external app control

This demo showcases the possibility of controlling an external process from an Electron app.

## Installing

`npm install`

## Running

`npm run start`

## Monitoring

The process ID is displayed in the web UI before the output, so you can use `ps -p <pid>` to monitor it in an external terminal.
